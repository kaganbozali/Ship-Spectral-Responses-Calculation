# Ship-Spectral-Responses-Calculation(Heave-Pitch)
The aim of this study is to obtain the ship motions (heave and pitch) and compare the results obtained with the variance preserving method. The parameters given in the specified code are the ratio of ship length to wavelength and are taken as constant. By using these parameters, the wavelength was changed and the calculation was made.
