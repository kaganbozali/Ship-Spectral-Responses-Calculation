# Ship-Spectral-Responses-Calculation(Heave-Pitch)
The parameters given in the specified code are the ratio of ship length to wavelength and are taken as constant. The number of wavelengths has been increased with interpolation. By using these parameters, the wavelength was changed and the calculation was made.
